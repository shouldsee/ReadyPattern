#Ready Pattern
Collection of PDE simulators that runs on READY https://github.com/GollyGang/ready.

* Modulus CML:
	Non-traditional CA with state space extended to real number.
	
* Annilatable 2D replicator (GS):
	Different from previous GS replicator, this one follows a seesaw growth fashion.
* Uskate reminiscent(GS):
A modification of mufano's glider-viable Gary-Scott system.
Length of timestep is varied along the horizontal axis (high on right). 
The parameter is chosen to visualise the behavior near the onset of numerical explosion. 
Also see Robert Munafo&apos;s U-skater. http://mrob.com/pub/comp/xmorphia/uskate-world.html
      
* OnsetOfInstability(GS):
	Close inspection at the parameter space where standing wave solutions becoming unstable. 1D,2D,3D scenarios are explored near the onset of instability, where a perturbation grows insteads of decaying away.
